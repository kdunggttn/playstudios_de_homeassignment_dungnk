    Hello. I am Daniel Nguyen (kdunggttn@gmail.com). 

    This is my submission for the PlayStudios DE Home Assignment. I've chosen to use Streamlit to build this web app.

    Use the .xlsx file **supplied with the Home Assignment** (or the file named `ORIGINAL_DATASET.xlsx` included with 
    the repo, which is the original xlsx file given to me, for easier access) in `Step 1 - Upload data` of the 
    Streamlit web app to come along with me, as we validate, clean and ultimately insert the processed data into PostgreSQL.

    **IMPORTANT**: Please do not skip any steps (if this is your first time here), and try to follow the steps in order,

    If you accidentally skip a step, you will be greeted with a warning message.
